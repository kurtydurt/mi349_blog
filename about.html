        <h2>About Sam Kurtzman</h2>
        <p>Sam Kurtzman has been a devoted listener to Hip Hop for about as long as he can remember. He is also the host of Impact 88.9FM's Hip-Hop, RnB, Funk, and Soul specialty show: The Vibe, hosted from 8 - 12PM on Saturday night. When he isn't listening to music you can likely find him wandering local nature trails or burying his head in whatever book he is reading at the moment. He insists on only reading one at a time.</p>

        <h3>Most Listened to Albums as of Summer 2023</h3>
        <img src="AllTimeFavs.png" alt="A Big chart of Sam's Most-Listened to Albums">
        <p>Sam would like to highlight some fun outliers on the chart above, to show that his music taste is not entirely a one-trick pony. Jai Paul makes a significant appearance with his only (not even self-released) album quite high up. In addition, there is a perhaps slightly unhealthy amount of Smiths, and a respectable Steely Dan selection, Can't Buy A Thrill. Eagle-eyed readers may spot some Alvvays or even The Strokes. Perhaps some Cocteau Twins has snuck in there as well. </p>
